# Movie-Success-Correlation
Movies are successful due to many different factors, as an avid movie fan, I wanted to explore the correlation between such factors
Analyzing the correlation between movie success, budget and many other factors through data viz libraries and further analysis.

Learning goals:
1. Learning Python data analysis basics
2. Using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn
3. Try out some basic analysis in Jupyter notebooks

My first project!
